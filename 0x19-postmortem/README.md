Title: Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 8, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 8, 2023, 12:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: The main web application was down for approximately 2.5 hours, affecting 75% of the users. Users experienced intermittent connectivity issues and slow response times during the outage.

Timeline:
- 10:00 AM: The issue was detected by an engineer who noticed a sudden spike in error logs and received reports from users about the unavailability of the web application.
- Actions Taken: The investigation focused on the web server, database, and networking components. Assumptions were made that the root cause could be related to a recent deployment or a database performance issue.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: Initially, attention was focused on recent code changes, leading to extensive code reviews and rollbacks. Additionally, database queries were optimized based on assumptions of performance degradation.
- Escalation: As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team and the database administration team for further analysis and assistance.
- Resolution: After extensive troubleshooting, it was discovered that the issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer, resulting in traffic being directed to an inactive web server. The load balancer configuration was corrected, and services were restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to the incorrect routing of traffic to an inactive web server. This caused the web application to be unavailable for users.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was updated to ensure proper distribution of traffic among active web servers. Additionally, thorough testing was conducted to validate the load balancer's functionality and stability.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Improve Configuration Management: Implement rigorous change management processes and validation checks to prevent misconfigurations in critical components like the load balancer.
   - Task: Develop and implement a standardized configuration management process, including documentation and peer reviews for all configuration changes.

2. Enhance Monitoring and Alerting: Strengthen monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect similar misconfigurations and prevent prolonged service disruptions.
   - Task: Implement comprehensive monitoring for load balancer health, including alerts for any discrepancies in traffic distribution and server status.

3. Conduct Regular Load Testing: Perform routine load testing on the web application and load balancer infrastructure to identify and address potential scalability and configuration issues.
   - Task: Develop a load testing strategy and schedule regular load tests to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify any performance bottlenecks or misconfigurations.

4. Improve Incident Response Procedures: Review and update incident response procedures to ensure a more streamlined and efficient response to similar issues in the future.
   - Task: Document and communicate revised incident response procedures, including clear escalation paths and responsibilities, to minimize downtime and facilitate quicker resolution.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar outages and enhance the overall stability and resilience of our web stack infrastructure.

In conclusion, the web stack outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer. Through thorough investigation and collaboration, the issue was identified and resolved. Moving forward, we will focus on improving configuration management, enhancing monitoring and alerting, conducting regular load testing, and refining our incident response procedures to prevent similar incidents and ensure a more reliable web application experience for our users.
